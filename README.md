# Plasma Mobile Configuration
This repository contains recommended configurations for distributions shipping Plasma Mobile by default.

Most settings here were removed for Plasma 6, as Plasma Mobile now handles them through `plasma-mobile-envmanager` [here](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-mobile/-/tree/master/envmanager).

Changes:
* Locking the screen as soon as the session has been entered (ex. from SDDM autologin)
* Default maliit config
