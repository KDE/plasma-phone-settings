This repository contains recommended configurations for distributions shipping Plasma Mobile by default.

Some important changes include:
* Locking the screen as soon as the session has been entered (ex. from SDDM autologin)
* Setting the default look-and-feel package
* Set the default keyboard to maliit-keyboard
* Prevent some unneeded applications from showing in the app list
